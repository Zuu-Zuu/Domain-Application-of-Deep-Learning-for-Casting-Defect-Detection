# Domain-Application-of-Deep-Learning-for-Casting-Defect-Detection

This project implements an automated image classification system for detecting casting defects using a hybrid deep learning model that combines a Custom CNN with ResNet50. The goal is to enhance quality control in manufacturing by providing a fast, accurate, and scalable alternative to manual inspection.

## Project Overview

- **Problem**: Manual casting inspections are slow, error-prone, and not scalable.
- **Objective**: Build a robust model to classify grayscale images of castings into `Defective` or `OK`.
- **Solution**: A hybrid deep learning model combining Custom CNN and ResNet50, trained on a labeled industrial dataset.

---

## Model Architecture

- **Custom CNN**: Extracts domain-specific features unique to casting defects.
- **ResNet50**: Pre-trained network for general feature extraction.
- **Ensemble Design**: The output from the custom CNN is passed into ResNet50 for final classification.

## Dataset

- Source: Public dataset containing 7,348 grayscale images of submersible pump castings
- Split:
  - **Training**: 6,633 images  
  - **Testing**: 715 images
- Classes:
  - `ok_front` â€” non-defective
  - `def_front` â€” defective

## Preprocessing

- Image resizing to 224Ã—224
- Normalization (mean = 0.5, std = 0.5)
- Data augmentation: horizontal flip, slight rotation (Â±10Â°)
